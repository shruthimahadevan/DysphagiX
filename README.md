# Esophageal Motility Disorder Classification

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the classification of esophageal motility disorders using Machine Learning (ML). The model is trained using Random Forest Classifier to predict different disorders based on clinical measurements:

Integrated Relaxation Pressure (IRP)

Distal Latency (DL)

Distal Contractile Integral (DCI)

Additionally, the model includes Solid Perfused and Water Perfused diagnoses based on IRP thresholds.
